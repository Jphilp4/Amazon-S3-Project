# 🚀 Amazon S3 Project Overview

Just wrapped up a thrilling Amazon S3 project—challenge mode engaged!

## Project Highlights
- ✅ Created and configured an Amazon S3 bucket, complete with ACLs, versioning, and public access.
- ✅ Uploaded website content, diving deep into how static websites function and how to host them on S3.
- ✅ Tackled public access settings and fixed an interesting challenge with the website's visibility.
